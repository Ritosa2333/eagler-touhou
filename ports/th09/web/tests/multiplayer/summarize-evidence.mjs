## Successful optimization

Fixed WASM and identical inputs, serial A/B/A; 1,800 logical frames per run.
Every restore was checked against the original execution's state inventory and
framebuffer. Each run also passed recording chunk and motion rewind checks.

| Run | Capture total ms | Restore total ms | Capture + forward + restore ms | Initial byte counter | State/image comparisons |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
${rows}

Capture plus restore time decreased **${f(comparison.reductionPercent)}%** against
the mean of the two dense runs. Including forward execution and its first-write
capture overhead, measured work decreased **${f(comparison.countedWorkReductionPercent)}%**.
These totals cover 270 saves/restores and 1,620 forward ticks, after a 180-tick
warmup. Verification hashing, image encoding and the second execution are excluded.
This is not total game FPS. The initial journal/owner byte counter decreased
**${f(comparison.bytesReductionPercent)}%**; it excludes subsequent first writes,
attack-state clones and container/callback metadata, so it is not total snapshot
size or allocated-memory use.

Local scheduling delay is **0 frames**, compared with the former 6-frame queue
(100 ms at 60 Hz). C++ tests check same-frame input use and once-only capture.
The browser test matches independent exact-input gameplay and Replay. This does
not claim zero device-to-display delay.

## Correctness and transport

- Five 600-frame C++ network conditions: steady, jitter, spike, all fast input
  lost, and loss/reordering/duplicates. All converge with once-only captures.
- ECL/effect ownership survives destruction and reuse; all nine attack types
  restore; production adapters compile without RTTI.
- Three additional 1,800-frame character pairs with round reset: (2,4), (6,9),
  (10,12). 810 further full-state/framebuffer comparisons pass.
- Two independent browser worlds plus exact-input reference: 900 frames,
  matching audit, image, hash and 1,312-byte Replay.
- Standalone UI: pause/resume, round reset, whole-world retry, completion, local
  Replay saving, reconnect and disconnect pass.
- Real local RTC and WebSocket fallback: 25–61 ms injected one-way delay and an
  800 ms spike. RTC also drops fast input. An admitted spectator consumes
  confirmed input. Audio contexts run and their clocks advance.

| Transport | Peer frames | Corrections | Resimulated frames | Spectator frame | Elapsed s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
${transports}

Development runs stop at exactly 600 frames and compare all three world hashes.
The release smoke has no test-only frame limiter: endpoints can stop on different
frames, so final hashes are compared only at equal frames. Native periodic
confirmed-hash checks remain active in every run. The transport workload has a
14-second upper bound for 600 ticks, including startup and the injected outage,
to catch recovery accidentally consuming normal simulation time. Historical
pre-fix timing remains in the ignored transport-before-scheduling report.

## Limits and reproduction

Desktop Chromium/SwiftShader results do not establish physical-phone or public
TURN acceptance. Audio clock progress does not establish absence of underruns.
An outage exceeding the eight-frame prediction limit still pauses simulation.

See [migration and commands](https://github.com/YomotsuHisami/eagler-touhou/blob/991e7cdf9060252e022eba25431254c6a0ce73e9/ports/th09/docs/multiplayer/rollback-migration.md). After reproducing the named
reports, run \`node web/tests/multiplayer/summarize-evidence.mjs\`. It fails
if a report fails, a WASM identity differs, or sparse capture fails to beat both
dense runs.
